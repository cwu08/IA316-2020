### I. Dataset
The Parameters of our dataset: 

- 943 users

- 1682 songs

- 100000 rows

- 5 keywords per song: title, duration, loudness, tempo, key

- 9 types of event, event strength and listening time per user per song

We generated this dataset on our own:

1. The 5 keywords per song comes from the songs dataset downloaded here https://github.com/thomasSve/Million-Song-Dataset-Analysis/tree/master/datasets

2. The "943 users+ 1682 items+ 100000 rows" structure comes from the 'u.data' used in the notebook "3a_movieLens_dataset_solutions" downloaded here https://github.com/thibaultallart/IA316-2020/tree/master/notebooks

3. The 9 types of event, event strength and listening time per user per song are generated by ourself.

| Listening operation | Strength |Subsequent operation| Strength|
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Have listened  it completely | +1 | Like | +1|
| Listen it frequently  | +3 | View Song Information | +1|
| Skip it | -1 | Add it to your music | +2 |
| Skip it frequently| -3 | Download | +3 |
| NaN| NaN | Don’t recommend it anymore | -2 |

### II. Notebooks to have a look at

- Coding the main enivironment and the "Random", "UCB", "Linear UCB" agents:

1. "Spotify Recommendation (Large dataset).ipynb" to see the coding of the enivironment and the agents and the experiments using the large dataset of 100000 rows

2. "Spotify_Recommendation (Smaller dataset).ipynb" to see the experiments using a smaller dataset extracted by the condition "user_id<=200".

- Coding the same main enivironment and the "ALS" agent:

3. "ALS_vs_random.ipynb" to see the coding of the "ALS" agent and its regrets.
